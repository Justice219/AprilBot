# Background
April is a c# chatbot aimed to respond to atleast 80% of all english slang
and give you a humanlike, curated response. April doesnt save any user data
and relied soley on keywords that the user sends to make a response.

For example, if you ask the bot  ¨How are you doing¨, then it will respond
with a list of given responses to make the interaction seem more human.

Currently, April is in build v0.12 and isn´t closed to being finished.
I have no idea if i am going to ever continue this project into v1 or
laster unless i stay motivated, but until then, the project will remain
in constant updates!

# Usage
April doesnt have a current build as it doesnt currently doesnt have anything
apart from a few responses and a simple introduction. Once settings and more
responses have been given, i will build the project.

You always have the choice of cloning the project in VS or copying the code
and compiling it yourself, its your choice though.
